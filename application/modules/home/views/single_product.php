The space

My dear friends Raquel and Eduardo Ocampo designed and built the Seashell House and for many years no one knew that it was possible to stay here and fewer knew how to arrange a stay. I decided it was too special to keep to myself and I invited the world via AIRBNB !!! Raquel and daughter Vane are your hosts at this unique island paradise . If crowded pools, lobby's and the "tourist bubble" are not your idea of an escape then the SEASHELL HOUSE may be the perfect place for your stay in ISLA MUJERES. Nearest airport : Cancun International Nearest port :. Puerto Juarez (downtown Cancun adjacent) or Playa Tortugas (Cancun hotel zone) Nearest beach : we face the rocky north side of the island and the best beach is north beach which is 15 minutes away by golf cart. El Garrafon snorkel park is a short distance in the opposite direction. Maximum guests is exactly as specified ...there is space for four . Isla Mujeres is 7 km long and 650 meters wide. Arrive by convenient taxi (6USD)or by golf cart(35 USD PER DAY) to THE SEASHELL HOUSE(S) PRIVATE GATED PROPERTY IN RESIDENTIAL ISLA MUJERES ISLAND ~ PRIVATE POOL ~ ONE KING BED IN EACH HOUSE The residential area is on a cliff side of the tiny island to allow privacy. You are not right in the middle of all the tourists but getting to the most beautiful beaches is easy with a golf cart or taxi. Of course, privacy is sometimes lost as tourists on golf carts notice the spectacular architecture and stop to gawk over the fence making you suddenly understand how celebrities feel. The smaller rounder shell has an immaculate KING BED and private bath with shower and a tv with a wide array of channels in English and in Spanish. The private bath with shower is made of tile and shells . The taller shell has a sitting area downstairs and KITCHENETTE with a large fridge, microwave, gas stovetop and sink with all the tools you need to enjoy meals .

Come to Isla Mujeres for a vacation that you will never forget, one that you will have fond memories of all year long...until you come . The houses sleep FOUR PEOPLE TOTAL.

Of course, this could not be any house. Octavio, a famous painter and needed something unique. Eduardo at first wanted a palala...but this was not allowed...having been very influenced by the "mountains" of seashells all around, he was inspired to actually construct a seashell. This would be the vacation home of his brother (in Cuernavaca) , it would be rounded on the inside, the spiral staircase... just inside the shell, a door where there was the mouth of the shell and windows with the form of shells THE LEGEND : Years later Eduardo would be tickled to learn that the islanders had created a sort of legend which goes like this ... The fisherman of Isla Holbox met with the fisherman of Isla Mujeres to boast of their individual islands...Isla Holbox sounded "Our island is where you find the biggest fish in the world !" The fisherman of Isla Mujeres responded "We are proud to have the biggest shell in the world !" The biggest shell ? Yes the biggest shell !!! When we found it we made ceviche for all of the islanders...and then we sold it to a gringo that lives in it now !" Though the owners are not gringos...they still laugh when they hear the legend. Guests can use the BBQ and parking lot . Raquel and her daughter Vanessa are at the adjacent property . If you cannot find her for your needs you may interact with cleaning or pool staff or leave a message . The neighborhood is beautifully peaceful and quiet . At night it is very dark and very serene . A golf cart is necessary as the Seashell House is located in a residential area. I serve to make your stay possible as I wanted to share it with the world but Raquel is the owner ... Please treat the homes with respect so that she continues to enjoy renting

THE HISTORY :

In 1994 architect Eduardo Ocampo arrived in Isla Mujeres and built a house for himself (and later met his wife Maria Raquel) His brother Octavio Ocampo visited frequently, Eduardo had two pieces of land in a quaint residential area with caribbean sea views....and wished to build on his lot for his brother.

Of course, this could not be any house. Octavio, a famous painter and needed something unique. Eduardo at first wanted a palala...but this was not allowed...having been very influenced by the "mountains" of seashells all around, he was inspired to actually construct a seashell. This would be the vacation home of his brother (in Cuernavaca) , it would be rounded on the inside, the spiral staircase... just inside the shell, a door where there was the mouth of the shell and windows with the form of shells

THE LEGEND :

Years later Eduardo would be tickled to learn that the islanders had created a sort of legend which goes like this ... 
The fisherman of Isla Holbox met with the fisherman of Isla Mujeres to boast of their individual islands...Isla Holbox sounded "Our island is where you find the biggest fish in the world !"
The fisherman of Isla Mujeres responded "We are proud to have the biggest shell in the world !"
The biggest shell ?
Yes the biggest shell !!!
When we found it we made ceviche for all of the islanders...and then we sold it to a gringo that lives in it now !"

Though the owners are not gringos...they still laugh when they hear the legend.

The Monferrato is, with its deep-rooted enological traditions, an area in which you can find the top quality wines such as Barbera, Freisa, Grignolino and Cortese; it is possible to visit the wine cellars of high-qualified productors. 
In the mansion, you can have access as well to the wine cellar carved in tuff of the late XIXth century, with the typical "infernot", barrels and an ancient press to produce wine.
